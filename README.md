# Birds in the City: Urban Habitat & Bird Observations

# Project Overview
This project analyzes urban bird habitat patterns in Colorado Springs
using remote sensing and field-based bird observations. Vegetation quality
and land-cover patterns were examined to better understand where birds
are more frequently observed in the city.

# Data Sources
- Sentinel-2 imagery (NDVI)
- Survey123 bird observation data
- Study area: Monument Valley Park and surrounding urban areas

# Methods
1. Created cloud-masked Sentinel-2 composites
2. Calculated NDVI to assess vegetation quality
3. Applied unsupervised K-means land-cover classification
4. Conducted a spatiotemporal NDVI comparison across years
5. Visually compared vegetation patterns with bird observation locations

# Tools Used
- ArcGIS StoryMaps
- Google Earth Engine
- ArcGIS Pro
